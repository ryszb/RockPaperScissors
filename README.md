# Rock paper scissors

A variant of popular rock, paper scissors game extended to support additional gestures like "lizard" and "Spock".

## Project

A C# .NET application with UI made in WPF using Domain Driven Design principles.

The game allows to play human and computer controller players. Currently there are two types of computer players supported. A basic computer player makes moves randomly and tactical computer player makes a move that could beat the opponent's move in the previous round. It's easily extensible to cover more gestures or different types of players.

## Rules

From the Big Bang Theory:

> Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.

Enjoy!
